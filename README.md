# 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction

This project predicts plant diseases using machine learning.  
It includes:
- A **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) for interactive predictions  
- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`ds_final.ipynb`) for experiments & analysis  

## 🚀 Features
- Synthetic dataset generation  
- RandomForestClassifier model  
- Streamlit-based UI for predictions  
- Shows prediction probability & model accuracy
